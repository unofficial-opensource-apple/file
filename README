The 'file' subdirectory is based on the vendor branch @ svn+ssh://src.apple.com/svn/BSD/file/vendor/file-5.04

For now, the version needs to be manually updated in the "Other Files" target, "Man Pages" phase.

Also, until Xcode provides an easy way to build host targets, the compilation of
magic.mgc relies on the builder's version of file. <rdar://problem/7140945>
